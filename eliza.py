# This program creates a chat bot assistant ELIZA, a psychotherapist
# It is an interactive chat bot assistant which constantly takes inputs
# from the user and replies to the user accordingly.
# The functionalities of this chat bot are,
# 1.In the start, the chatbot greets the user by saying good morning or
#   afternoon or evening based on the time of the day.
# 2.To become more interactive the chatbot grabs the name of the user 
#   and displays it for every new message.
# 3.The chatbot also detects the improper language and reports it to
#   the user to use a proper language.
# 4.The chatbot also uses timer and if the user does not enter any input
#   for 20 seconds then the chatbot ask to enter an input.
# 5.If any gibberish is entered the chatbot tells the user that it is
#   not aware of those words.
# 6.If anything other than alphanumeric characters are entered then it
#   asks the user to enter only alphanumeric characters.
# 7.If any question is entered saying 'what is',the chatbot searches for
#   that particular word in the wordnet and gives the meaning of that
#   word.
# 8.The chatbot always has an answer though anything unknown to it is entered
# 9.The program quits on saying quit,bye,exit,good bye.
# The algorithm of the chat bot is, it takes input from the user and 
# and checks for that input in the dictionary of responses which is pre-defined
# if the key is found then a random value from a list of values of the
# corresponding key is taken.
# Additional functionalities: The functionalities 1,3,4,7,8 from the above
# are the additional functionalities.
# Example:
#Good evening, I am ELIZA, your chatbot assistant.
#[Eliza] Hello, Please type in your name
#[user] I am Nikhith

#[Eliza] Hello Nikhith, how are you today?
